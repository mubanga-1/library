# 📚 Library
## Description
A simple web-based library application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project is part of [The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library), focusing on object constructors, DOM manipulation, and user interaction.
